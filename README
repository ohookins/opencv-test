These are just worked examples in Python based on:

Learning OpenCV
by Gary Bradski, Adrian Kaehler
ISBN: 978-0-596-51613-0

Software used:
 - Python 2.7.1
 - OpenCV 2.3.1

Some exercises and examples haven't been attempted. For the most part this is
due to me just being lazy, but in some cases they just don't make sense for
Python or the C++ code doesn't translate to Python (missing functionality in
the libraries, or unnecessary low-level manipulation such as with pointers).
